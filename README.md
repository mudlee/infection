# Epic Story

You wake up and remember nothing. You see a paper on the ground in front of you that says: "Sergeant, the ship got infected by an unknown alien form. We successfully left, but the hibernation center where you were was broken. If you wake anyhow, please rescue the remaining people we could not save. Good Luck, don't die!"
